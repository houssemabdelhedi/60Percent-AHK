# 60Percent-AHK

This repository provides scripts and tools to enhance the usability and productivity of 60% keyboards (or any keyboard).

## Prerequisites

### Required
- **[AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/)**: A powerful scripting language required to run the provided scripts.
- **[FancyWM](https://github.com/fancywm/fancywm)**: A lightweight and customizable window manager for efficient desktop navigation. This is essential for maximizing the utility of the scripts.

### Optional
- **[Dual Key Remap](https://github.com/ililim/dual-key-remap?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)**: A tool to remap the Caps Lock key into a dual-function key for better usability.
  - Example: Single press acts as `Escape`; hold and combine with other keys to act as the `Win` key.
- **[SharpKeys](https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys)**: A simple registry-based tool for remapping keys if additional custom remaps are needed beyond what the scripts provide.

## Shortcuts
